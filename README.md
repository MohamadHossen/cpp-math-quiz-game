# Math Quiz Game in C++

Console game that asks the user random math questions and calculates the score.

## Features
- Random math questions (addition / subtraction / multiplication ...)
- Levels or difficulty (easy / medium / hard) [if you added them]
- Score and result at the end
- Input validation for user answers

## What I practiced
- `if` / `else` and nested conditions
- `for` / `while` loops
- Functions to organize the code
- Working with `rand()` for random questions
- Basic problem solving with C++

## How to run
1. Compile `main.cpp` with any C++ compiler.
2. Run the program in the console and follow the instructions.
